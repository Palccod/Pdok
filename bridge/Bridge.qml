pragma Singleton
import QtQuick

// Engine-wide rendezvous between Pdok's service and its bar widget, for
// bar hosts that cannot resolve plugin services themselves. The Omarchy
// shell scopes each widget's `bar.shell` facade to the widget's own plugin,
// so `bar.shell.serviceFor("palccod.pdok")` reaches the live service under
// the first-party bar. Replacement bars (e.g. ruixen.bar) are handed a
// facade whose serviceFor() is a deliberate null stub -- Omarchy never
// exposes service resolution to them -- and there is nothing the bar can do
// about it from its side. So the widget falls back to this singleton: the
// service registers itself here on completion, and any widget that cannot
// reach its host picks it up. The host-provided path stays primary, so
// behaviour under the stock shell is unchanged.
QtObject {
  // The live Service.qml instance once it has initialized, or null.
